Before instituting my propoundment, Let us be of common terms on our understanding of Sharia, O beautiful reader! 

- Let it be known that Sharia is commonly and incorrectly labeled "**sharia law**" Thereby let this be known as Sharia. Such a system is not alien nor unusual to man as usually portrayed, rather it strikes similitude to the Judaic concept of the [halakha](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Halakha "Halakha")

- Let it be known that Indeed Sharia is not a rigid code as it's usually portrayed, but rather an interpretive system, serving to bring the divine commandments to life. The implementation of Sharia varies from land to land, for the strictness of the laws, the specifics of the laws, and the application to non-believers may differ dependent on society. Remember that Sharia is not a single entity, but a diverse system of topics, the application of which varies in accordance with the will of the Islamic deity Allah.

O readers!  Did they (the religious enterprise) not ponder regarding their lord commanding of his dominion? Did they not find religious law cloven with absurdity in the slightest proportion?
