I discern in advance how closely this ties to the problem of evil and biological determinism, and hence both issues shall not be fully cloven. "Repeat a lie a thousand times, and it becomes the truth." Unfortunately, there's sadly some truth in this statement; especially with Hell. Masters of deceptions & storytelling, the forefathers of many faiths, were able to build their whole religious enterprise on these deceptions, one of, if not the most widespread sadistic concept to be held by humans that reeks through the masses.

Indeed, A great iniquity is presented from such a large population. The lack of regard for the sanctity of life or dignity of a human being leaves me empuzzled even from a young age discussing with my father the fate of many, the idea of hell has cast onto me a spiritual lobotomy and remains a shackle of fear to me.

Verily, if oneself discerns an idea of an eternal Hell, unending suffering; a place which according to some faiths will be a place of fire puss and blood tortures devoid of dignity, indeed casts this abode as the sadist of beliefs. The viewpoint that many souls will perish and be chucked like worthless dirt into an abode means that oneself has to either relinquish the viewpoint that God wishes to save all beings or accept the viewpoint that God wants to save all, but cannot or will not complete this responsibility and rather satisfy his own desires in such a matter, or fail to act upon the matter indeed suggesting that he is not an omnipotent or omniscient deity.

  
  

People who are still engrossed in such grotesque credence indeed, consider the following. Although problematic to quantify human evilness, let us delegate an analogy and quantify the evil, with a common factor being murder count. Let us make use of these abominable human beings' quantity being murder.

  

| Jeffrey Dahmer - Serial Killer:Â  17 People (Own Hands)

  

| Gongsun Qi - Human Butcher: 1000000 People (Own Hands)

  

We can constitute these crimes in a numerical fashion and now the scales of justice (Al-Mizan/Archangel Michael) edict that a punishment be issued that fits the crime but appears to us a contradiction of that, issuing an infinite grotesque devilish punishment; hell for a finite crime:

  

1 - âˆž = -âˆž

1000000 - âˆž = -âˆž

Vice Versa:

  

âˆž -1 = âˆžÂ 

âˆž -1000000 = âˆž

That is by definition is infinitely disproportionate; Verily this is not justice, and it certainly isn't mercy, rather reminiscent of the devil ruling a universe, it's actually grotesque in fact and immoral. The renowned mathematician and child prodigy, Blaise Pascal (An INTP ðŸ˜Ž) stated that:

  

The finite is annihilated in presence of the infinite, and becomes pure nothingness.

Or Issac Asimov, who stated that:

Infinite torture can only be a punishment for infinite evil, and I don't believe that infinite evil can be said to exist even in the case of HitlerÂ Â 

  

  

To view from a retrospect, this idea of god; reminiscent of a criminal kingpin, made an offer we can't refuse. Simply put, you either worship and glorify me following my rules or I subject you to suffering in this world and grotesque suffering and torture in hereafter resulting from a right I gave you in an arbitrary universe, blowing dust into the eyes of his believers of free when indeed biological determinism and environments are thee accomplices.

A page on biological determinism and the rules of life more in depth shall be created in due time given however for now consider the following words. It's saddening how astray and engrossed people are made to believe a predicament for god for which God created the penalty for unintentional ignorance which is an eternity of sadistic and gruesome torment in a black fire. In this delusion word of many, your commonplace serial killer like Jeffery Dahmer for example who spent his life murdering 17 males in a truly profoundly horrific fashion; Convicted of Rape, dismemberment, necrophilia, and cannibalism would only need to repent to god and come closer to him and after a scrumptious last meal on death row (Ended up being murdered in prison) would end up in paradise. A subjective idea as such on life expels true moral accountability from the dominion of ethical conducts . This kind of faith really is the perfection of narcissism.

Due to the nature of the concept, infinity whether your edict adobe pertains to hell because you're a murderous psycho from the streets of Wisconsin or a loving human who chose to deny the faith or someone who simply fell in love with someone of the same sex due to temperament, the result if normalized lika a 3D unit vector is exactly the same; an eternal fire blood and pus whether your crime has a numerical value of 17 or 1 million. No matter what paradigm follows, the sentence is the same minus infinity how's that for fucking grotesque justice when those that preach this sadistic nonsense presume their right to lecture people on morality, mockery would quite frankly be the kindest response at the disposal of a critic for something like Hell.
