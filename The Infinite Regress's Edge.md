They (the religious enterprise) whose hands contain vast arguments puts forth that which, many, entail the necessitation of a conscious agent needing to exist, reminiscent of the eternal theist archetype of god. Exalted is an emperor in the world of fallacies none other than the notable infinite regression, whereof credit is upon it, holds well in its intellectual prowess and fared well in the test of time.

A thorough recap is as follows, the fallacy of the Infinite Regress occurs when an infinite series of objects or entities are within the dominion of recursion. A principle is cloven from this and posits that we cannot have an infinite amount of proceeding entities or events; in such a scenario the cosmos shall never be able to reach its current destination of time and series of events. They conclude that there indeed be present a first cause or supreme proprietor of this existence (objection B&W fallacy).

Let us delegate an example whereof a communication platform for a studio named Alterra exists and therein beholds a vast hierarchy of unimagninble proporations. He (the staff member) awaits an order from his higher-up to announce a new update for its new product called Proximus. The higher-up asks its higher-up if it's ok to announce and the process bears its recursive burden. Eventually, we must come to a relevant higher-up that allows this announcement otherwise, the staff member will never be able to announce the update. For the opposition, this elevates the arguement whom they say indeed be present a supreme propioriter whom must be the first cause or gives permission to declare an action.

The creationists behold this recapitulation into the beginning of our universe. The claim is propounded forth therein they postulate "Indeed we cannot have an infinite amount of proceeding entities that led to this universe" Such a connotation strikes similitude to those who say "there cannot be a creator of the creator, otherwise we would find assurance within the infinite regress. Does such a criterion however rest the doubtful and exalt this dispute?

Should we declare a creator to the dispute, By nature certitude is expected. However, do the benefactors of the dispute among whom are theist not see distinctly the same questions posed to them? They are to be met with an equitable dilemma.

Let the one who ponders, consider their gods nature, his attributes against the dispute? Verily people whom raise this predicament shall uncover the same fallacy. A problem is cloven from from the theist archetype of god due to the attributes assigned to him, in specific the ever-lasting and eternal.

Let the reader consider if he were to work backward from the beginning of the universe, an equitable dilemma is displayed. He who does as such is burdened with the same blunder, striking similitude to the staff member. We can discern that the event could not happen before God had performed the action. They (benefactors of the dispute) are left with an infinite regress of the deity they worship. They are left with an infinite regress of their lord actively choosing not to create the universe. Indeed, the ponderer is left with an infinite amount of time existing before their deity actively chose to create the universe. 

The only remaining objection that could be given is god's existence residing outside the fabric of his creation which includes time and his omnipotence, however in my personal humble opinion this seems like a complete non answer. This is the usual theist's fallback onto unfalsifiable statements which would connotate a definitive answer onto the reality of existence outside this universe, this is noncommittal and biased in proof in comparison to their opposition.

The accepted definition of time and according to many philosophers, mathematicians and physicists is a continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future

If we were to entertain this idea of god's outside existence, it would be fallacious to suggest. Within the paradigms of our existence and Our discussion, and the realm within which you're reading this, should you find things would always be an unbroken sequence of moments, every moment being an effect of the moment before that which caused it. If such a paradigm does not apply to god, then it seems problematic for god to create this universe as it could not preform a series of sequential steps there shall be an oscillating state of creation to non-creation and vice versa in such a dilemma present.

The last claim of god's all powerful nature in my discernment does not seem to solve the problem, as god would not do something illogical and break the fundamental laws of his universe, in this case being cause and effect. To the very least, god's nature must consist of at least two sequential events.
