The Prelude

Glad tidings be upon you to whom reads this, caution yourself before as this may slight upset or transgress your **sensibilities** and I must discern my love and value for the welfare of mankind. My aim is to speak the truth. Every topic this writing encompasses are in extreme early stages and yet to be further instated and articulated by me. 

I wish to make clear I am not free of biases or error, neither do I connotate as such, my opinion is what I hold, and you must treat with compassion and love as you wish to treated. I've decided as of now to keep my life and it's sufferings less direct, so this can resonate more to people from all walks of life.

Many topics may not end with a definitive conclusion, with this being insights into my mind, hence such a composition casts its paths to that of a manifesto. Many topics may also be a ring in the desert to the full depth I hold the topic at, and so will give it a short summary and remember that these MAY BE OPINIONS OR DILEMMAS;.

**Pangs Of Indoctrination**

Beware of indoctrination and it's pangs. Observe the likes of heavily indoctrinated religious people; predisposed to beauty and compassion turned engrossed in opposition and impossible to deal with. The brain and its neural pathways altered and physically changed on the path of spiritual and moral stagnation, defending irrational and misguided beliefs, fantasies regardless of the rational and recognized truths and scientific facts and recognized truths presented to them.

Verily, Indoctrination and its damage can be everlasting; a menacing persuasive serpent that feasts on the emotional conditioning of the human mind. Such a serpent can influence people to blindly accept falsehoods and reject reality, and because of some truly grotesque actions. For some like myself had, it's possible to help others break free from the indoctrination by appealing to their emotions, by showing them how they have failed to provide evidence and reasoning for what they claim as facts, and by questioning their beliefs.

**Gardens Of Peace**

Indeed, peace is the most important and blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every human being. Verily, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, Peace strengthens and restores. May peace prevail on this earth and beyond.

"The most important thing in life is to have inner peace" - Gayatri Shome

**The Sealed Serpent** 

The most dangerous creatures among us and among mankind are fake companions and deceptive people, it's important you know that in the words of the motivational speaker Jim Rohn he states ‚Äúyou are the average of the five people¬†you spend the most time with.‚Äù and so it's important to make sure these people don't affect your life. Such people are the ones who will pride upon your failure and be envious of your success. Remember though at the end of the day, real situations expose fake people, so close pay attention.

**The Libertarian Dilemma**

This not only extends onto a dilemma for a theist concept of god, but also a key fault into the orthodoxy of libertarianism. Within the deep abyss of the human condition and mind do you find people share irrational and entitled ideas regarding it. Exist masses that pretend and self-delude that they've been entirely self-made. They seem to feel responsible for their intellectual fruits and characteristics, responsible and entitled to their freedom from grave suffering, injury and disease, and a criterion for that they were born at a specific moment in humanity's history. 

Many are deep in error and that they show not any awareness of how lucky one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard and diligent one works. Indeed, one must be lucky for the basic privilege of being¬†_able to work_. One must be lucky to be of sane mind, to not have the likes of ataxia, or to not have been burdened by the evils of other human beings.

**The Injudicious Misogyny** 

The need to explain the evils of misogyny in the modern era is a testament to the human's natural predisposition to competitiveness and discrimination. Misogyny, a disease rampant within the cultural and religious enterprise; an idea to uphold the primate mindset and likes of the Bronze Age at bay. The evils of misogyny stem from it being a form of discrimination. Is it absolutely wrong? This indeed is a question for philosophy. Philosophers have conversed for and against discrimination of different groups since the beginning of time.

It's saddening the idea of not discriminating a sentient creature based on biological sex and  is relatively new in the history of humanity. Essentially, we live in a society that says each sex is equal to the other. This has improved the welfare for a lot of women in our society by a great deal. Globally, one can see examples of the horrors that sexism causes, in particular, the treatment of women in parts of the Arab world.


__*GATES OF FAITH*__

**The Insight Of Hell's Gordian Knot**

I discern in advance how closely this ties to the problem of evil and biological determinism, and hence both issues shall not be fully cloven. "Repeat a lie a thousand times, and it becomes the truth." Unfortunately, there's sadly some truth in this statement; especially with Hell. Masters of deceptions & storytelling, the forefathers of many faiths, were able to build their whole religious enterprise on these deceptions, one of, if not the most widespread sadistic concept to be held by humans that reeks through the masses.

Indeed, A great iniquity is presented from such a large population. The lack of regard for the sanctity of life or dignity of a human being leaves me empuzzled even from a young age discussing with my father the fate of many, the idea of hell has cast onto me a spiritual lobotomy and remains a shackle of fear to me.

Verily, if oneself discerns an idea of an eternal Hell, unending suffering; a place which according to Sunni Islam will be a place of fire puss and blood tortures devoid of dignity, indeed casts this abode as the sadist of beliefs. The viewpoint that many souls will perish and be chucked like worthless dirt into an abode means that oneself has to either relinquish the viewpoint that God wishes to save all beings or accept the viewpoint that God wants to save all, but cannot or will not complete this responsibility and rather satisfy his own desires in such a matter, or fail to act upon the matter indeed suggesting that he is not an omnipotent or omniscient deity.


People who are still engrossed in such grotesque credence indeed consider the following. Although problematic to quantify human evilness, let us delegate an analogy and quantify the evil, with a common factor being murder count. Let us make use of these abominable human beings' quantity being murder.

	Jeffrey Dahmer - Serial Killer:  17 People (Own Hands)

	Gongsun Qi - Human Butcher: 1000000 People (Own Hands)


We can constitute these crimes in a numerical fashion and now the scales of justice (Al-Mizan/Archangel Michael) edict that a punishment be issued that fits the crime but appears to us a contradiction of that, issuing an infinite grotesque devilish punishment; hell for a finite crime:

1 - ‚àû = -‚àû
1000000 - ‚àû = -‚àû

Vice Versa:
‚àû -1 = ‚àû 
‚àû -1000000 = ‚àû

That is by definition is infinitely disproportionate; Verily this is not justice, and it certainly isn't mercy, rather reminiscent of the devil ruling a universe, it's actually grotesque in fact and immoral. The renowned mathematician and child prodigy, Blaise Pascal (An INTP üòé) stated that:

```
The finite is annihilated in presence of the infinite, and¬†becomes pure nothingness.
```

Or Issac Asimov, who stated that:

```
Infinite torture can only be a punishment for infinite evil, and I don't believe that infinite evil can be said to exist even in the case of Hitler  
```

To view from a retrospect, this idea of god; reminiscent of a criminal kingpin, made an offer we can't refuse. Simply put, you either worship and glorify me following my rules or I subject you to suffering in this world and grotesque suffering and torture in hereafter resulting from a right I gave you in an arbitrary universe, blowing dust into the eyes of his believers of free when indeed biological determinism and environments are thee accomplices.

Due to the nature of the concept, infinity whether your edict adobe pertains to hell because you're a murderous psycho from the streets of Wisconsin or a loving human who chose to deny the faith or someone who simply fell in love with someone of the same sex due to temperament, the result (normalized similar to a 3D unit vector due to some faiths having up to 7 tells for types of crimes) is exactly the same; an eternal fire blood and pus whether your crime has a numerical value of 17 or 1 million. No matter what paradigm follows, the sentence is the same minus infinity how's that for fucking grotesque justice when those that preach this sadistic nonsense presume their right to lecture people on morality, mockery would quite frankly be the kindest response at the disposal of a critic for something like Hell.


Quote Bank:

```
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. 
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. 
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?‚Äù
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?

	Greek Philosopher Epicurus -¬†341 BC
```



```
The Prophet (Ô∑∫) said, "In very hot weather delay the Zuhr prayer till it becomes (a bit) cooler because the severity of heat is from the raging of the Hell-fire. The Hell-fire of Hell complained to its Lord saying: O Lord! My parts are eating (destroying) one another. So Allah allowed it to take two breaths, one in the winter and the other in the summer. The breath in the summer is at the time when you feel the severest heat and the breath in the winter is at the time when you feel the severest cold."

	Sahih al-Bukhari 536, 537

```


```
Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more often. So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish.

	Sahih Bukhari Volume 9, Book 87, Hadith Number 155

**The Deity Of Narcissism Or Love?**

According to Melinda Smith and Lawrence Robinson from the HelpGuide institute, one of the pillars of narcissism is the grandiose, constant need for admiration. The religious people will continue to suffer, oscillating between the crushing narcissistic wounds of religious superiority from other faiths engrossed in salvation and inferiority in the slave complex created within theism. 

Indeed, it's very common a hypocrisy of many faiths, such that; Do they not see grandiose abundance within the very deity they worship? This is a result of their conditioning; a hard puzzle to escape. For them, in god's mind, the whole universe exists solely to worship him: 

### [Isaiah 43:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A7&version=ESV)¬† 
"Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."

### [Surah Adh-Dhariyat - 56](https://quran.com/adh-dhariyat/56)
"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."

God‚Äôs idea of reaching heaven is a universe that is centered around his worship, a universe meant to seize on the Day Of Reckoning/Day Of Judgement: Yet worship consists only that of flattery. Do such people think this cosmos and sea of multiverses or this potentially infinite fractal existence, revolves around our mote of dust and the opinion of us hairless greater apes? 

Narcissists with little emotion and aggressively belittle, devalue or destroy those who threaten their grandiose self-image. It says God many times explains and warns his wrath on his followers whenever they turn their attention away from his worship. Anyone who refuses to do so is threatened with the idea that God will brutally torture them and harm them in the land of sadism known as Hell to those he considers his enemies: all Hindus, Muslims, Jews, atheists, and anyone else who lives for a purpose other than inflating his ego, glorifying him many times a day.


This was a reason for my becoming a liberal Muslim, Quranist and leaving mainstream Islam having little avenues to reconcile and set my sail to my personal path of spirituality and remain hopeful that god is not a narcissistic monster rather a creator of mercy and beauty who wouldn't damn a human being for using the brain given to him.
