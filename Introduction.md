**Pangs Of Indoctrination**

Beware of indoctrination and it's pangs. Observe the likes of heavily indoctrinated religious people; predisposed to beauty and compassion turned engrossed in opposition and impossible to deal with. The brain and its neural pathways altered and physically changed on the path of spiritual and moral stagnation, defending irrational and misguided beliefs, fantasies regardless of the rational and recognized truths and scientific facts and recognized truths presented to them.

Verily, Indoctrination and its damage can be everlasting; a menacing persuasive tool that can can influence people to blindly accept falsehoods and reject reality. It is possible to help others break free from indoctrination by appealing to their emotions, by showing them how they have failed to provide evidence for what they claim as facts, and by questioning their beliefs.

**Injudicious Misogyny** 

The need to explain the evils of misogyny in the modern era is a testament to the human's natural predisposition to competitiveness and discrimination. Misogyny, a disease rampant within the cultural and religious enterprise, to keep the likes of the Bronze Age at bay. The evils of misogyny stem from it being a form of discrimination.

Is it absolutely wrong? This is a question for philosophy. It is within human nature to be competitive and to discriminate. Philosophers have argued for and against discrimination of different groups since the beginning of time.

The idea of not discriminating based on biological sex is relatively new in the history of humanity. Essentially, we live in a society that says each sex is equal to the other. This has improved the lot of women in our society by a great deal. Globally, one can see examples of the horrors that sexism causes, in particular, the treatment of women in parts of the Arab world.
