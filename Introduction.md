Glad tidings be upon you to whom reads this, please caution yourself as certain things may upset or transgress your **sensibilities** and I must clarify my love and value for the welfare of all mankind regardless of protected characteristics as a skeptic, liberal Muslim and human being. My aim is to only share and inform my perspective of life as of (Date 09/11/2022), and nothing here is targeted to anyone :)



**Pangs Of Indoctrination**

Beware of indoctrination and it's pangs. Observe the likes of heavily indoctrinated religious people; predisposed to beauty and compassion turned engrossed in opposition and impossible to deal with. The brain and its neural pathways altered and physically changed on the path of spiritual and moral stagnation, defending irrational and misguided beliefs, fantasies regardless of the rational and recognized truths and scientific facts presented in clear to them.

Verily, Indoctrination and its damage can be everlasting; a menacing persuasive tool that can can influence people to blindly accept falsehoods and reject reality. It is possible to hopefully help others break free from indoctrination like myself by appealing to their emotions, by showing them how they have failed to provide evidence for what they claim as facts, and by questioning their beliefs.


**Gardens Of Peace**

Indeed, peace is the most important and blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every human being. Verily, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, Peace strengthens and restores. May peace prevail on earth and beyond.

Within the deep abyss of the human condition and mind do you find people share irrational and entitled ideas regarding it. Exist masses that pretend and self-delude that they've been entirely self-made. They seem to feel responsible for their intellectual fruits and characteristics, responsible and entitled to their freedom from grave suffering, injury and disease, and a criterion for that they were born at a specific moment in humanity's history. 

Many are deep in error and that they show not any awareness of how lucky one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard and diligent one works. Indeed, one must be lucky for the basic privilege of beingÂ _able to work_. One must be lucky to be of sane mind, to not have the likes of ataxia, or to not have been burdened by the evils of other human beings.



**Injudicious Misogyny** 

The need to explain the evils of misogyny in the modern era is a testament to the human's natural predisposition to competitiveness and discrimination. Misogyny, a disease rampant within the cultural and religious enterprise, to keep the likes of the Bronze Age at bay. The evils of misogyny stem from it being a form of discrimination.

Is it absolutely wrong? This is a question for philosophy. It's within of us apes to be competitive and to discriminate. Philosophers have argued for and against discrimination of different groups since the beginning of time.

The idea of not discriminating based on
