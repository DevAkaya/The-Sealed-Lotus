The Prelude

Glad tidings be upon you to whom reads this, caution yourself before as this may slight upset or transgress your **sensibilities** and I must discern my love and value for the welfare of mankind. My aim is to speak the truth. Every topic this writing encompasses are in extreme early stages and yet to be further instated and articulated by me. 

I wish to make clear I am not free of biases or error, neither do I connotate as such, my opinion is what I hold, and you must treat with compassion and love as you wish to treated. I've decided as of now to keep my life and it's sufferings less direct, so this can resonate more to people from all walks of life.

Many topics may not end with a definitive conclusion, with this being insights into my mind, hence such a composition casts its paths to that of a manifesto. Many topics may also be a ring in the desert to the full depth I hold the topic at and so will give it a short summary and remember that these may be opinions or dilemmas.

**Pangs Of Indoctrination**

Beware of indoctrination and it's pangs. Observe the likes of heavily indoctrinated religious people; predisposed to beauty and compassion turned engrossed in opposition and impossible to deal with. The brain and its neural pathways altered and physically changed on the path of spiritual and moral stagnation, defending irrational and misguided beliefs, fantasies regardless of the rational and recognized truths and scientific facts and recognized truths presented to them.

Verily, Indoctrination and its damage can be everlasting; a menacing persuasive serpent that feasts on the emotional conditioning of the human mind. Such a serpent can influence people to blindly accept falsehoods and reject reality, and because of some truly grotesque actions. For some like myself had, it's possible to help others break free from  the indoctrination by appealing to their emotions, by showing them how they have failed to provide evidence and reasoning for what they claim as facts, and by questioning their beliefs.

**Gardens Of Peace**

Indeed, peace is the most important and blissful contribution we can make to the welfare and rights of every human being. Verily, peace is the desire of every heart, the hope of every nation and dominion, the promise of every politician; honest or deceitful, a pillar of every supplication and the outward beat of every religious agenda, Peace is the ultimate response and antagonist to many evils and suffering in life. Where evil, corrupts, destroys and tears apart, Peace strengthens and restores. May peace prevail on this earth and beyond.

**The Sealed Serpent** 

The most dangerous creatures among us and among mankind are fake companions and deceptive people, it's important you know that in the words of the motivational speaker Jim Rohn he states “you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” and so it's important to make sure these people don't affect your life. Such people are the ones who will pride upon your failure and be envious of your success. Remember though at the end of the day, real situations expose fake people, so close pay attention.

**The Libertarian Dilemma**

This not only extends onto a dilemma for a theist concept of god, but also a key fault into the orthodoxy of libertarianism. Within the deep abyss of the human condition and mind do you find people share irrational and entitled ideas regarding it. Exist masses that pretend and self-delude that they've been entirely self-made. They seem to feel responsible for their intellectual fruits and characteristics, responsible and entitled to their freedom from grave suffering, injury and disease, and a criterion for that they were born at a specific moment in humanity's history. 

Many are deep in error and that they show not any awareness of how lucky one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard and diligent one works. Indeed, one must be lucky for the basic privilege of being _able to work_. One must be lucky to be of sane mind, to not have the likes of ataxia, or to not have been burdened by the evils of other human beings.


**The Injudicious Misogyny** 

The need to explain the evils of misogyny in the modern era is a testament to the human's natural predisposition to competitiveness and discrimination. Misogyny, a disease rampant within the cultural and religious enterprise; an idea to uphold the primate mindset and likes of the Bronze Age at bay. The evils of misogyny stem from it being a form of discrimination. Is it absolutely wrong? This indeed is a question for philosophy. Philosophers have conversed for and against discrimination of different groups since the beginning of time.

It's saddening the idea of not discriminating a sentient creature based on biological sex and  is relatively new in the history of humanity. Essentially, we live in a society that says each sex is equal to the other. This has improved the welfare for a lot of women in our society by a great deal. Globally, one can see examples of the horrors that sexism causes, in particular, the treatment of women in parts of the Arab world.


**The Deity Of Narcissism Or Love?**

According to Melinda Smith and Lawrence Robinson from the HelpGuide institute, one of the pillars of narcissism is the grandiose, constant need for admiration. The religious people will continue to suffer, oscillating between the crushing narcissistic wounds of religious superiority from other faiths engrossed in salvation and inferiority in the slave complex created within theism. 

Indeed, it's very common a hypocrisy of many faiths such that; Do they not see grandiose or ego in abundance within the very deity they worship? This is a result of their conditioning; a puzzle of escape. For them, in god's mind, the whole universe exists solely to worship him: 

### [Isaiah 43:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A7&version=ESV)  
"Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."

### [Surah Adh-Dhariyat - 56](https://quran.com/adh-dhariyat/56)
"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."

God’s idea of reaching heaven is a universe that is centered around his worship, a universe meant to seize on the Day Of Reckoning/Day Of Judgement: Yet worship consists only that of flattery. Do such people think this cosmos and sea of multiverses or this potentially infinite fractal existence, revolves around our mote of dust and the opinion of us hairless greater apes? 

Narcissists with little emotion and aggressively belittle, devalue or destroy those who threaten their grandiose self-image. It says God many times explains and warns his wrath on his followers whenever they turn their attention away from his worship. Anyone who refuses to do so is threatened with the idea that God brutally will torture them and harm them in the land of sadism known as Hell to those he considers his enemies: all Hindus, Muslims, Jews, atheists, and anyone else who lives for a purpose other than inflating his ego, glorifying him many times a day.

This was a reason for my becoming a liberal Muslim, Quranist and leaving mainstream Islam having little avenues to reconcile and set my sail to my personal path of spirituality and remain hopeful that god is not a narcissistic monster rather a creator of mercy and beauty who wouldn't damn a human being for using the brain given to him.

**The Insight Of Hell's Gordian Knot**

I discern in advance how closely this ties to the problem of evil, and hence both issues shall not be fully cloven. "Repeat a lie a thousand times, and it becomes the truth." Unfortunately, there's sadly some truth in this statement; especially with Hell. Masters of deceptions & storytelling, the forefathers of many faiths, were able to build their whole religious enterprise on these deceptions, one of, if not the most widespread sadistic concept to be held by humans that reeks through the masses.
