Glad tidings be upon you to whom reads this, caution yourself before as this may slight upset or transgress your **sensibilities** and I must discern my love and value for the welfare of mankind. My aim is to speak the truth. Every topic this writing encompasses are in extreme early stages and yet to be further instated and articulated by me. 

I wish to make clear I am not free of biases or error, neither do I connotate as such, my opinion is what I hold, and you must treat with compassion and love as you wish to treated.

**Pangs Of Indoctrination**

Beware of indoctrination and it's pangs. Observe the likes of heavily indoctrinated religious people; predisposed to beauty and compassion turned engrossed in opposition and impossible to deal with. The brain and its neural pathways altered and physically changed on the path of spiritual and moral stagnation, defending irrational and misguided beliefs, fantasies regardless of the rational and recognized truths and scientific facts and recognized truths presented to them.

Verily, Indoctrination and its damage can be everlasting; a menacing persuasive serpent that feasts on the emotional conditioning of the human mind. Such a serpent can influence people to blindly accept falsehoods and reject reality, and because of some truly grotesque actions. For some like myself had, it's possible to help others break free from  the indoctrination by appealing to their emotions, by showing them how they have failed to provide evidence and reasoning for what they claim as facts, and by questioning their beliefs.

**Injudicious Misogyny** 

The need to explain the evils of misogyny in the modern era is a testament to the human's natural predisposition to competitiveness and discrimination. Misogyny, a disease rampant within the cultural and religious enterprise; an idea to uphold the primate mindset and likes of the Bronze Age at bay. The evils of misogyny stem from it being a form of discrimination. Is it absolutely wrong? This indeed is a question for philosophy. Philosophers have conversed for and against discrimination of different groups since the beginning of time.

It's saddening the idea of not discriminating a sentient creature based on biological sex and  is relatively new in the history of humanity. Essentially, we live in a society that says each sex is equal to the other. This has improved the welfare for a lot of women in our society by a great deal. Globally, one can see examples of the horrors that sexism causes, in particular, the treatment of women in parts of the Arab world.

**The Sealed Serpent** 

The most dangerous creatures among us and among mankind are fake companions and deceptive people, it's important you know that in the words of the motivational speaker Jim Rohn he states “you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” and so it's important to make sure these people don't affect your life. Such people are the ones who will pride upon your failure and be envious of your success. Remember though at the end of the day, real situations expose fake people, so close pay attention.
