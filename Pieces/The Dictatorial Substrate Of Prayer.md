The reasons for which people wish to pray is a vast valley in the gates of spirituality. I shall therefore be articulating this topic from a more personal perspective.

Observe prayer cloven from faith and find that for many, prayer or a persistent spiritual practice delegated to an agent provides them with a deeper essence of peace and comfort that of which spiritual belief may not be a reason. To many, prayer propounded to man as a form of meditation or mindfulness can be blissful and beautiful to a soul, striking similitude to the blooming of a lotus. Verily, such substrates of prayer can expand its essence to even providing someone with a meaningful fulfilment in their walk of life, redundant of a deity. This cascade vanishes for a multitude of man when we observe a system of forced devotion coerced by certain delegates of the religious enterprise, in my case the obligated Islamic concept of prayer; As-Salah.

Reaching certain junctures of my life, particularly at my time of being a passionate student of Islam and **advocate** of Salafism. What reached me was a terrifying statement of an alternate normalisation of a reality.  This to my discernment had been words cascading on deaf ears, not seeing a dire issue with the following.

>  Allah revealed to me a revelation, and He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night. Then I went down to Moses (peace be upon him) and he said: What has your Lord enjoined upon your Ummah? I said: Fifty prayers. He said: Return to thy Lord and beg for reduction (in the number of prayers), for your community shall not be able to bear this burden. As I have put to test the children of Isra'il and tried them (and found them too weak to bear such a heavy burden). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I went back to my Lord and said: My Lord, make things lighter for my Ummah. (The Lord) reduced five prayers for me. I went down to Moses and said. (The Lord) reduced five (prayers) for me, He said: Verily thy Ummah shall not be able to bear this burden; return to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. I then kept going back and forth between my Lord Blessed and Exalted and Moses, till He said: There are five prayers every day and night. O Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty prayers. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him; and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do, it will not be recorded for him; and if he does it, only one evil deed will be recorded. I then came down and when I came to Moses and informed him, he said: Go back to thy Lord and ask Him to make things lighter. Upon this, the Messenger of Allah remarked: I returned to my Lord until I felt ashamed before Him.

[Sahih Muslim](https://sunnah.com/muslim) » [The Book of Faith - كتاب الإيمان](https://sunnah.com/muslim/1) 
(Extra context suggests Allah refused to reduce it even further)


Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah formulated a book al-Tawassul wal-Wasīlah and therein he proposed: 

> The early generations said: The Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed and is not created. And they said that He speaks when He wills. Then they explained that the words of Allah are eternal, meaning that the divine attribute of speech is eternal.








> فَسُبْحَـٰنَ ٱللَّهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونَ 
> 
> So All Extolment be to Allah while you are in your evening hours and while you become (vigilant) in your morning hours [Surah Ar-Rum 30: 17](https://quran.com/en/ar-rum/17)

Indeed, propounded to me exists such an inequity of logic. Such dilemmas presented from this is as clear as that of the blazing sun as it manifests itself. Did they (the apostles of Islam) not consider the spoken word (Quran) of their lord is an eternal word free of alteration from mankind? No, rather, they committed an injustice degrading their lord. Such an act. It's injudicious that such people believe their lord can be bargained from his messenger Muhammad. A biased distribution of wisdom is indeed presented.  


It leaves for a multitude a hard empuzzlement
