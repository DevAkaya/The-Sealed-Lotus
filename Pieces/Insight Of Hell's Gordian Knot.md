Repeat a lie a thousand times, and it becomes the truth Unfortunately, there's sadly some truth in this statement; especially with Hell. Masters of deceptions & storytelling, the forefathers of many faiths, have been able to build their whole religious enterprise on these deceptions. Out of the vast number of control mechanisms conceived, hellfire is one of if not the most widespread sadistic concept to be held by humans, which finds residence in multitudes of mankind.

Indeed, a great injustice is manifested. The grotesque disregard for the sanctity of life or dignity of a human being can leave even the mind of the young empath stricken with confusion and dread. Such a matter casts, onto the populus and the innocent, a spiritual mutilation and can remain as an everlasting intellectual parasite. 

If oneself discerns an idea of an eternal Hell, unending suffering; a place which according to some faiths will be a place of fire puss and blood tortures devoid of dignity, this truly and indeed renders this odious destination as the most cruel of beliefs. They, the religious enterprise, postulate that multitudes of sentient creatures will perish and be flung like worthless dust into such an abode. Verily, whoever conceives such an idea of perpetual torment must concede with the following:

1. Renounce the postulation that God wills to save all beings. 
2. Accept the postulation that God wills to save all but cannot or will not fulfil these obligations and rather gratify his own desires in such a matter; or fail to act upon it, indeed suggesting that he is not an Ever-Determiner or Ever-Knowing deity.

People who are still engrossed in such grotesque credence indeed, consider the following. Although problematic to quantify human evilness, let us delegate an analogy and quantify the evil, with a common factor being murder count. Let us make use of these abominable human beings' quantity being murder.  

> Jeffrey Dahmer - Serial Killer:  17 People (Own Hands)

> Gongsun Qi - Human Butcher: 1000000 People (Own Hands)

  
We can constitute these transgressions in a quantified and measured state, and thus the scales of justice, as represented by the Al-Mizan or Archangel Michael, decree that a punishment be assigned that is correspondent with the severity of the offense. Yet, to our perception, the punishment bestowed therein shows its paradoxical and diabolical nature, involving an infinite and grotesque torment in Hell for a crime that is inherently finite.

> 1 - ∞ = -∞
> 1000000 - ∞ = -∞

Vice Versa:

> ∞ -1 = ∞ 
> ∞ -1000000 = ∞

This is indeed by definition is infinitely disproportionate; One thereby argues with sound reason that the very essence of punishing individuals for eternity for deeds they committed in their finite mortal existence is fundamentally malevolent. Such an existence strikes similitude to an existence belonging to the dominion of Satan.

> Some time ago a Clergyman was proving to me by arguments many and strong that hell was right, necessary, and just; that it brought glory to God and good to man; that the holiness of God required it as a preventive, and the justice of God exacted it as a penalty, of sin. I listened quietly till all was over and silence fell on the reverend denunciator. … All I found to say in answer came in a few words: “If I had not heard you mention the name of God, I should have thought you were speaking of the Devil”

Do you consider the magnitude of eternity? Indeed, It encompasses not merely a million nor a billion years, but rather an infinite duration of time. And yet, even for sins committed during this transitory nature of our existence, the punishment of everlasting agony is immensely severe and apathetic. It becomes inconsequential whether an individual caused the demise of one or countless millions, as the punishment remains identical. 

The nature of such horror seizes and squeezes tight on the innocence of its followers who wish to procreate. Any such soul wishing to uphold mercy ought to withdraw their act of procreation. Such an act, therein, is immensely reckless and unethical to knowingly bring forth a new soul that runs the risk of being consigned to an everlasting fate of indescribable anguish. Remarkably, this reality appears to not dissuade many adherents of religion, even those who uphold the belief that the majority of humanity is destined to suffer the tremulous fate.

A deity that can bestow such affairs strikes similitude to that of a criminal kingpin, offering an ultimatum that simply cannot be refused. Humankind was dragged into the dominion of this deity, devoid of any choice or affirmation. We are bestowed suffering and evil of such high magnitude and required to be grateful. One must either prostrate and glorify this being, upholding its commandments, or else face suffering in this life and unimaginable torture in the next. All as a result of a right arbitrarily bestowed upon us in a universe that seems designed to thwart our efforts to exercise free will. Such an affair is grotesque and biased in logic. 

It truly saddens me to see how easily people can be misled and become so engrossed in their whims of self-delusion. They are made to believe that a concept of beauty like god bestowed a penalty for those who unintentionally stray from the straight path, resulting in an eternity of sadistic and gruesome torment in a black fire. Such a system allows even the most transgressive of criminals, such as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, to potentially be admitted through the gates of paradise by repentance and a closer relationship with God. Such a horrific idea is infested with subjectivity that lack little room for true moral accountability in the realm of ethical conduct, and it is the very height of narcissism.


The concept of infinity is such that it makes no distinction between the inhabitants of hell. Devoid is the matter, judging between to a murderous psychopath from the streets of Wisconsin, a loving human who chooses to deny the faith, or one who simply falls in love with someone of the same sex due to temperament. The result is always the same: eternal fire, blood, and pus, regardless of whether the crime in question has a numerical value of 17 or 1 million.

<u>Gordian Knot Of Division</u>

The Abrahamic Hell is stricken with another injustice. As the divine scales have proceeded their weighing. The convict either awaits his entrance to Paradise or the pits of Hell. This tells us that there is a standard of morality expected to be followed by god. If the option is binary, then we can construct a wall between the groups of people. At some point of the room inwards towards the barrier. You would beside the two sides of the wall, a group of people who are almost morally no different to one another.
