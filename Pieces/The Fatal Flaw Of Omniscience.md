As I'd discerned in the previous writings, such as my view on [[The Infinite Regress's Edge]], They (the religious enterprise) commit grave blunders in the attribution of their lords. 

> If this is your God, he's not very impressive. He's got so many psychological problems; he's so insecure. He demands worship every seven days. He goes out and creates faulty humans and then blames them for his own mistakes. He's a pretty poor excuse for a supreme being.

Attending to a friendly debate, within the Modern-Day-Debate discord server, did I come across a profound question. They (the delegated management) put forth the topic “is god compatible with free will?” that of which the context was pertaining to the christian deity. Why and how does such matters confer with omniscience? 




> Most intriguingly, at the nexus of these formal approaches a new ontology of reality is becoming most apparent. Two novel mantras are spreading through humanity’s collective mind: “Information is physical” and “Information represents the ultimate nature of reality.” These surprisingly simple assertions have many deep consequences. Information theory is the wellspring of our contemporary digital world. Computation is, in essence, information processing. Then, information can be harnessed for mechanical work. Moreover, some of the pioneers of modern theoretical physics have, for a long time, suspected that information plays a fundamental role in nature. One striking consequence of this paradigm is that reality is inherently finite. Infinities can only be found in the abstract thought systems of the human mind.
